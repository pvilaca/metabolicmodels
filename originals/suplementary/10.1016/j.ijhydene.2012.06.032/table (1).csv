        Growth rate and hydrogen production from glucose and glycerol for different mutant strains. Growth rate (h−1). H2<comma> CO2<comma> acetate<comma> PFK<comma> EDD<comma> GND<comma> RPE represent flux values of the corresponding reactions (mmol/gDW/h). The PFK reaction represents EM pathway<comma> EDD represents the ED pathway<comma> GND represents the OPP pathway and RPE represents the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. BPCY is the biomass-coupled product yield (mmol/gDW/h2) and ΔH2 is the fractional increase in H2 production over the wild type.
